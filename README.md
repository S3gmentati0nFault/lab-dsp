# Distributed and Pervasive Systems exercises (lab)
My twist on all of the exercises proposed in the laboratory phase of the course of Distributed and Pervasive Systems at Universit√° degli studi di Milano, kept by professor Bettini.

The code can be downloaded through the release or through a clone of the repository, since the exercises tend to change every year this should be used as a guideline to understand what the course is about and what kind of level the student is expected to reach by the end of the course. You can find the code of the project associated with the course at the following link

In this repository you can find:
  - An exercise about messaging systems using sockets
  - Concurrent access to servers in C-S architectures
  - GRPC
  - HTTP and REST
  - MQTT

## Disclamer
Even if I would like to go ahead and correct some of the exercises I have a lot on my plate right now, thus I will put them as to-dos in the README because I think it would actually be worth it to change how some of the things work in there.

## To-do:
  - [x] Complete the documentation for the project
  - [ ] Add a Group class to simulate a group-chat in the ChatGPT exercise
  - [ ] Check the synchronization statements in the Dictionary exercise
  - [ ] Change the POST endpoint to a PUT endpoint for the Dictionary exercise
